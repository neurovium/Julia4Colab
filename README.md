# Julia4Colab

There are two notebooks:
- One shows how to install Julia for the first time and set packages. These packages can be used using %%shell julia -e 'JULIA CODE TO EXECITE' or can be used in "IJulia" for which you have to setup the notebook to read Julia kernel.
- The other file is to use already existent packages, without the need to install them. Again this can be done either in python or directly in IJulia framework.
